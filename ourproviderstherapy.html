                <p class="card-text">Karen Farrar is a Master’s prepared Licensed Clinical Social Worker. After graduating with honors from Michigan State University, I devoted my career to working toward empowering individuals and families who are seeking to regain control of their lives. My commitment remains steadfast to work with people who are struggling to find their foothold in life due to circumstances beyond their control. I firmly believe that it is the strength and resolve of our humanness that brings us to places of higher awareness and understanding. Working together toward self-empowerment through strategic individualized treatment goal planning is key. 

Lets face it—life can be challenging at times. It is my firm belief that true power comes from seeking to understand why we, as human beings, respond to circumstances that occur in our lives in certain ways. A pro-active approach of self-analysis promotes the healing process, which allows one to become an active participant in their life. <br>
